# Numerical Methods with Python

This repository contains Python implementation of key algorithms and concepts from my Numerical Methods course. 

## Topics Covered
- Floating Point Representation and Error Analysis
- Root Finding Methods (Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant)
- Interpolation Techniques (Lagrange, Newton)
- Numerical Integration (Trapezoidal, Simpson’s Rule)
- Numerical Differentiation
- Solving Linear Systems (Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition)
- Iterative Methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel)
- Eigenvalue Problems
- Ordinary Differential Equations (Euler, RK Methods)
- Curve Fitting and Regression
- Linear Programming (Simplex Method)

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – for matrix and numerical computations
- **SciPy** – for numerical analysis algorithms
- **SymPy** – for symbolic computation and equation solving
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive learning and demonstrations
